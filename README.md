# Employee-Retention-Project

Hiring and retaining employees are extremely complex tasks that require capital, time and skills.

“Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate any income such as hiring”.

“Companies spend 15%-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a new candidate”.


“An average company loses anywhere between 1% and 2.5% of their total revenue on the time it takes to bring a new hire up to speed”.

Hiring a new employee costs an average of $7645 (0-500 corporation).

It takes 52 days on average to fill a position.

You work as a data scientist at a multinational corporation.
